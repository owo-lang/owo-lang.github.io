## Subprojects

We do experiments, in steps.

+ Stage zero, [minitt][minitt]
+ Stage one, [voile][voile]

 [minitt]: https://github.com/owo-lang/minitt-rs
 [voile]:  https://github.com/owo-lang/voile-rs

We dig through the history, trying to find something interested but forgotten.
We refactor the projects to fit state-of-the-art compilers and make IDE (IntelliJ plugin) for them.

+ A revived [Mini-TT][mtt]
+ A revived [MLPolyR][mpr]
